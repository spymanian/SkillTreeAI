Introduction Navigating career choices can be overwhelming. Our AI-assisted career path exploration web app aims to simplify this process by leveraging Groq, React, React Flow, and Llama. This MVP will allow users to input their academic background, interests, hobbies, and skills to generate an interactive career roadmap. The roadmap, visualized as a branching timeline, will suggest potential career routes and the milestones needed to achieve them.

Technology Stack Groq - For high-performance inference, enabling efficient LLM calls.

React - The frontend framework for building a dynamic and interactive UI.

React Flow - A library for visualizing career paths as interactive flowcharts.

Llama (Meta AI's LLM) - The AI model for generating career recommendations and paths.

FastAPI/Flask (optional) - Backend API to process user inputs and fetch AI-generated insight
